# Routeco : Your Route Comrade

## Definition

Routeco is a mobile app that created to know about weather and air polution to your destination and give some recomendation to bring mask, umbrella or rain coat.

#

## Summary

Humans are very closely related to mobility. In doing mobility, everything needs to be prepared, such as the condition of the destination path. In this case, we focus on from small scope for South Jakarta citizens and people who are in Jakarta that have issues with weather and air quality that will be encountered during the trip.

We raise the issue to give ease to every person in their mobility to find out about the weather and air quality at the location they want to go. We use the concept of geolocation that focuses on tracking destination paths and predicting the environment condition, such as Weather Forecasting and Air Quality prediction, in order to increase user convenience. 

We also use a reliable dataset, such as bmkg.go.id to provide accurate information to users. Several features such as, ‘dirty air warning’ that gives notification to use masks, ‘bad weather warning’ that gives notification to use of umbrellas or rain coats for those users who ride motorcycles, makes all users prepare before they are traveling around the city. That will be an interesting feature from us that gives more convenience to users.
